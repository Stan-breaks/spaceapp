# **Interactive Orrery Web App for Celestial Bodies and Space Debris Prediction**

## **Project Overview**

This project is part of a NASA hackathon, aimed at developing an interactive orrery web app that displays various celestial bodies, including planets, Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), Near-Earth Comets (NECs), and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). The web app also integrates a high-performance API service to predict space debris movements and potential collisions in real-time.

By addressing the growing issue of space debris, this app provides a powerful
tool to help protect critical space infrastructure, ensure the safety of future
space missions, and support the sustainable use of Earth’s orbits.

## **Key Features**

- **Interactive 3D Visualizations**: Real-time display of planets, NEAs, NECs,
  and PHAs with zoom-in and zoom-out functionality.
- **API for Space Debris Prediction**: An API service that predicts debris
  movement and potential collisions using orbital mechanics.
- **Detailed Information**: Select celestial bodies to get detailed data like
  their speed, orbit, and proximity to Earth.
- **Embeddable**: The web app can be easily embedded on any webpage.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Serverless app**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) – for client-side rendering andoptimized performance.
- **Data Visualization**: recharts for the graphs and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for rendering celestial objects in 2D/3D.
- **Data Source**: NASA's databases for accurate real-time data on celestial
  bodies.

## **Installation** To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone
   https://github.com/your-repo/orrery-web-app.git 
   cd orbital 
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies** Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run the
   following command: `bash npm install `

4. **Start the Development Server** Start the server and launch the app in
   development mode: `bash npm run dev ` Open
   [https://spaceapp-self.vercel.app](https://spaceapp-self.vercel.app) to view
   the app in your browser.

## **Usage** 
1. **Interactive Orrery**: Use the app to visualize celestial

objects by zooming in and out. Select an object to view more information. 

## **Future Improvements**

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Leverage machine learning models to improve
  prediction accuracy for space debris movements.
- **Create more visual appealing Bodies**: Enhancing the graphics of the web
  app; making the celestial bodies more visually appealing.
